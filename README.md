## Weather App

Create a Weather app web application using the framework and libraries of your choice (React/Vue/Svelte/Vite/NextJS/etc). The weather application should use the MapBox API (https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/#forward-geocoding) in order to enable the user to search for a city, and then render the current weather information for that city using Weatherbit (https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current). When clicking a search result, it should load a dedicated page for that city and display the city name, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, the feels like, the wind speed, and the wind direction.
